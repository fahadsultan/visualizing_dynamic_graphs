# Visualizing Dynamic Graphs 

The project aims to develop novel methods for visualization of dynamic functional connectivity networks derived from Functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. These methods built on my previous work that looks at dynamic network-based biomarkers for later 
in life neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers and other dementias.
